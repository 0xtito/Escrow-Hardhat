# Decentralized Escrow Application

This is an Escrow Dapp built with [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/).

## Project Layout

There are three top-level folders:

1. `/app` - contains the front-end application
2. `/contracts` - contains the solidity contract
3. `/tests` - contains tests for the solidity contract

## Setup

Install dependencies with `npm install`.

## Contracts

You can use hardhat commands to test and compile the contracts, among other things.

To learn more about these commands run `npx hardhat help`.

## Front-End

To run the front-end application move into the `app` folder and run `parcel index.html`.

You can learn more about Parcel [here](https://parceljs.org/).
